      "Expanded Polystyrene, a petroleum based product that is frequently used for food service purposes, enters the various water bodies from both direct as well as indirect sources (such as storm conveyance systems), and contributes to the degradation of the overall quality of streams, ocean waters and adjacent beach areas",
      "Expanded Polystyrene does not effectively biodegrade (decay into constituent substance) in the environment, but merely breaks down into smaller particles, that litter the City's streets, parks, public places, and open spaces and eventually is carried to the area's beaches and ocean",

      "Expanded Polystyrene waste poses a risk to the fragile ecological balance, since marine and land wildlife often perish as a result of ingesting Expanded Polystyrene products. This risk can occur over and over again since Expanded Polystyrene remains in the ecosystem for a very long time",

Also, plastic products, including expanded polystyrene, makeup 80-90% off floating marine debris",
      "The City boundary includes numerous creeks and other waterways, which are an important natural resource as exemplified in various policies of the City's General Plan. Expanded polystyrene products break apart into small pieces and ultimately flow to the Pacific Ocean contributing to concerns related to water quality and habitat protection both within the creek system as well as the marine environment",
